# Predicting-how-likely-individuals-are-to-receive-H1N1-vaccines
The public health organization is interested in finding the response of individuals to the H1N1 vaccine in 2010, if a majority took it or not. With the cropping up of global pandemics like COVID-19, public health has become very critical and a priority to the government and health sector. For this reason, they saw it fit to study vaccines, and specifically, whether individuals get them or not. Having been approached with this, we look to build a classification model that will establish whether indivuals took the h1n1 vaccine and the factors that were correlated to them and predict individual's possible reaction to a case like this in the future. This will help the stakeholders to establish a feasible way to approach this issue in future.

We apply machine learning for this project because it will give the stakeholders a view of trends in individuals' behaviors in relation to their response to vaccines, as well as supports the development of new vaccines if need be.

    "The data used in this project was retrieved from [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/). The dataset contains data on training features, training labels, test features and the submission format. The data on the training features (the input variables that the model will use to predict the probability that people received H1N1 flu vaccines and seasonal flu vaccines) contains 35 feature columns in total, each a response to a survey question. These questions cover several different topics, such as whether people observed safe behavioral practices, their opinions about the diseases and the vaccines, and their demographics.The data on training labels (the labels corresponding to the observations in the training features) contains two target variables : h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine. Both are binary variables, with 1 indicating that a person received the respective flu vaccine and 0 indicating that a person did not receive the respective flu vaccine."
